# Introduction to working with satellite imagery and geospatial data for your arts project.

Earth observation data, whether it is from above (by satellites) or below (by sightings), can be challenging to get in to when you're not a scientist. On the one hand there's the scientific lingo ("what does slempgevoeligheid even mean?"), and on the other hand technical jargon and knowledge of the operations ("WMS, WFS, WCS? What!?"). Yes, there IS a lot of data. Yes, getting to/through it IS confusing.

In this hour we will:
- Look at an overview of where the data comes from. From sightings to earth observation.
- Look at different places where data is stored, and how to obtain it.
- How to bring different kinds of data together, and then export it so we can use it in software which is more suitable for more artistic purposes!
